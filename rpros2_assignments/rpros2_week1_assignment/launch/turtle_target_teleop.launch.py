# Week 1
# Assignment:
#  
# Launch File for Turtle Teleoperation and Visualization
#
# This launch file starts the turtlesim node, launches the TurtleTargetPlotter
# node that visualizes the turtle position and random target squares, and opens a
# separate terminal window to run the TurtleKeyboardController node for interactive
# keyboard teleoperation. The launch ensures all three components run together for
# a seamless Week 1 assignment demonstration.
